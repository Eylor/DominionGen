# DominionGen
A small project that creates playable setups for the board game Dominion.

File Overview:
  This project is effectively broken down into two essential components.
  1: URLtoDB: a web scraper to gather card info from websites and store in a database.
  2: DomGen: chooses 10 cards to play with within the specified parameters.
  
  Additionally, the .db file that URLtoDB creates has been included.
